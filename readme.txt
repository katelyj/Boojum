Welcome to Kate and Bayle's final project: Deal or No Deal!

When looking at the Github commit history, Mr. Brown, please remember that Kate's SSH key from her home computer is whack. 
For some reason, those commits are shown under a different user!
So if some of the graphs look like she did no work, that is incorrect, as she did quite a lot.
(Maybe look at the commit history rather than those graphs...)

To launch:

$ javac *java
$ java Driver
