Big to-dos:
Make a dealer class and have the dealer make a deal after each round
Write the end to the game: when you choose the deal, or one of the two last briefcases
Write audience reactions (lol the best class obviously)

Small to-dos:
improve layout
make a how-to-play thingy for new users
nicer commentary

Far in the future:
cheats???
optimization??????
