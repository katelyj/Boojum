Kate and Bayle's Devlog

2016-01-13 Kate
Today was the start of our project devlog.
After Kate had her vision that came to her in a dream, we discussed our new project plan, drawing diagrams and flowcharts and all of that neat stuff.
Then, after getting Mr. Brown's seal of approval, we began to make the basic structures for our classes.
We also created the driver file, DealOrNoDeal.java, and wrote some basic contents.
Tomorrow, we will further develop Briefcase and Player, our two most important classes at the moment.
We will also discuss the relationships between all our prospective classes.
RIP David Bowie.

We worked on displaying the game board.
We also made to-do.txt, a UML diagram, and a flowchart.
In class, we worked on choosing your initial briefcase.
At home, we worked on the progression of the same (choosing briefcases and all that fun stuff). 
We now have a very basic layout of our game coded.
RIP Alan Rickman.

Today was a very productive day. In class, Bayle worked on starting the Dealer class while Kate wrote the very end of the game: the finalTwo method.
Then, at home, Kate edited the Dealer class to make it work with the driver class, and implemented it at its appropriate places.
Our game now runs how it should, at its bare minimum.
Next up to work on is class CaseHolder, and then possibly the superclass for all our characters.

Kate worked on printing the numbers with their proper commas.

Bayle created the CaseHolders and their helpful responses and she implemented it in the driver class so that after each case opening, there would be a response. 
Also, before the dealer was only offering $0; Bayle set them straight.
Kate edited CaseHolders and expanded it more, adding more possibilities for responses and changing minor algorithmic things.
