Kate and Bayle's Devlog

2015-01-13 Kate

Today was the start of our project devlog.
After I had my vision that came to me in a dream, Bayle and I discussed our new project plan, drawing diagrams and flowcharts and all of that neat stuff.
Then, after getting Mr. Brown's seal of approval, we began to make the basic structures for our classes.
We also created the driver file, DealOrNoDeal.java, and wrote some basic contents.
Tomorrow, we will further develop Briefcase and Player, our two most important classes at the moment.
We will also discuss the relationships between all our prospective classes.
RIP David Bowie.

We worked on displaying the game board.
We also made to-do.txt, a UML diagram, and a flowchart.
In class, we worked on choosing your initial briefcase.
RIP Alan Rickman.
